Project: Building and Integrating a Custom Context EngineObjective: To create a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that finds the most relevant code and documentation from your project's codebase, formats it, and provides it to Claude to dramatically improve the quality and relevance of its assistance.Phase 1: Foundational Backend - The Indexing & Retrieval EngineGoal: Create the core service that can ingest your codebase and find relevant snippets on demand. This phase is all about the backend data processing.Step 1.1: Data Ingestion & ChunkingAction: Develop a Python script (ingest.py) that intelligently scans your repository and breaks down source files into meaningful chunks.Key Technologies:gitpython library to programmatically access files tracked by Git (respects .gitignore automatically).tree-sitter library for parsing code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This is far superior to simply splitting by lines, as it allows you to create chunks based on logical blocks like functions, classes, or methods.Outcome: A script that outputs a stream of JSON objects, where each object is a "chunk" containing:id: A unique identifier (e.g., filepath:function_name).filepath: The source file path.content: The actual code of the chunk (e.g., the full text of a function).language: The programming language.metadata: AST-derived info like function name, class name, imports, etc.Step 1.2: Setup Indexing InfrastructureAction: Deploy the two databases that will store your indexed code: a vector database for semantic search and a full-text search engine for lexical search.Key Technologies:Vector DB: Milvus. It's open-source, high-performance, and well-suited for code embeddings.Full-Text Search: Elasticsearch. It's the industry standard for keyword search, filtering, and ranking.Deployment: Use docker-compose.yml to easily spin up both Milvus and Elasticsearch instances for local development.Outcome: A running local environment where both databases are accessible.Step 1.3: Build the Indexing PipelineAction: Enhance your ingest.py script to populate the databases.Key Technologies:sentence-transformers: Use a code-specific model like BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 or sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 to convert your code chunks into vector embeddings.milvus-sdk and elasticsearch-py Python clients.Process:For each chunk from Step 1.1:Generate a vector embedding from its content.Store the embedding and the chunk's id in Milvus.Store the raw content and all metadata in Elasticsearch, using the same id.Outcome: A fully indexed codebase, ready to be searched.Phase 2: The Core API - Serving the ContextGoal: Expose the retrieval engine's functionality through a simple, robust API that your IDE can call.Step 2.1: Create the API ServiceAction: Build a lightweight web server to handle search requests.Key Technology: FastAPI (Python). It's incredibly fast, easy to use, and has automatic documentation generation.Outcome: A basic FastAPI application with a /health endpoint to confirm it's running.Step 2.2: Implement the gather_context EndpointAction: Create the main API endpoint that performs the hybrid search.Endpoint: POST /gather_contextRequest Body: { "query": "your natural language query", "top_k": 20 }Logic:Receive the query.Generate an embedding for the query using the same sentence-transformer model.Semantic Search: Query Milvus with the vector to get the top_k most similar chunk IDs.Lexical Search: Query Elasticsearch with the query text to get the top_k best keyword matches.Merge & Deduplicate: Combine the results from both searches into a single list of candidate chunks.Outcome: An endpoint that returns a list of potentially relevant code chunks for any given query.Step 2.3: Implement Reranking and Token BudgetingAction: Refine the candidate list to select only the absolute best snippets that fit within a token budget.Key Technology: A Cross-Encoder model (e.g., cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2). Cross-encoders are highly effective for reranking tasks.Logic (within the gather_context endpoint):Take the merged list of candidates from the previous step.For each candidate, use the cross-encoder to calculate a precise relevance score between the query and the chunk's content.Sort the candidates by this new, more accurate score.Iterate through the sorted list, adding chunks to your final context and summing their token counts until you reach a predefined budget (e.g., 4096 tokens).Outcome: The API now returns a highly relevant, optimally-ranked, and size-constrained block of context, ready to be sent to Claude.Phase 3: IDE Integration - Bringing It to Your WorkflowGoal: Create a simple VS Code extension to seamlessly connect your editor to your new context engine.Step 3.1: Create a Basic VS Code ExtensionAction: Use the official Yeoman generator (yo code) to scaffold a new TypeScript-based extension.Outcome: A "Hello World" extension that you can run and debug in VS Code.Step 3.2: Add a "Get Context" CommandAction: Define a new command in package.json and implement its handler in extension.ts.Command Name: myProject.getContextLogic:The command can be triggered via the Command Palette or a keybinding.It should grab the user's currently selected text in the editor. If no text is selected, it can pop up an input box asking for a query.Make a fetch call to your FastAPI backend's /gather_context endpoint with the query.Outcome: An extension that can fetch context from your API based on your actions in the IDE.Step 3.3: Integrate with the Clipboard and ClaudeAction: Make the fetched context immediately usable.Logic:When the API response is received, format the context snippets into a clean, readable block of text. Prepend each snippet with its file path.Use the vscode.env.clipboard.writeText() API to automatically copy this context block to the user's clipboard.Show a VS Code information message: âœ… Context for your query has been copied to the clipboard! (Tokens: 3850).User Workflow:Highlight some code or a comment and press your keybinding.Go to your Claude chat interface.Paste (Ctrl+V) the context.Type your question (e.g., "Based on the context above, refactor this function to be more efficient.").Outcome: A seamless, one-click workflow to provide Claude with hyper-relevant context from your project.Phase 4: Measurement and OptimizationGoal: Make the system continuously better by establishing a quality baseline and automating tests.Step 4.1: Create a "Golden Dataset"Action: Create a simple CSV file (golden_dataset.csv) to track performance.Columns: query, expected_snippet_id, notesExample Row: "how do we handle user authentication?", "src/auth/middleware.ts:jwt_verify_function", "This is the core auth logic"Process: Populate this with 20-30 real-world questions and the "perfect" code snippet you'd want the system to find.Step 4.2: Automate Evaluation in CI/CDAction: Create a Python script (evaluate.py) that runs every query from your golden dataset against the API and measures the results.Key Technologies: pytest, GitHub Actions.Metrics to Track:Recall@10: Did the expected snippet appear in the top 10 results?Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): How high up in the ranking was the correct snippet?Outcome: A CI job that runs on every pull request, ensuring that changes to your indexing or ranking algorithms don't cause a quality regression. This turns system improvement into a measurable science.
