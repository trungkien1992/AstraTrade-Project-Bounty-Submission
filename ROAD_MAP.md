We understand the vision for a gamified perps trading app. We've built a functional mobile app that integrates with the Extended API and Paymaster. We've implemented a core set of
gamification features (XP, leaderboard, ecosystem) to create an engaging experience. We have a clear design vision for the app's UI/UX, as demonstrated in our design proposal. We're a dedicated team ready to take full ownership of this idea
