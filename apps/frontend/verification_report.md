3. **Unused Imports**: 23 warnings
   - **Impact**: Minimal - slightly larger bundle size
   - **Fix**: Clean up unused imports

### Recommendations for Production

1. **Update Deprecated APIs**: Gradually replace `withOpacity` calls
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Add more granular error types
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement analytics for the new services
4. **Test Coverage**: Fix the 2 failing tests for complete coverage
