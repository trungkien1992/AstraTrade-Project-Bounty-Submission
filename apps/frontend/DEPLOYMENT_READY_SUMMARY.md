  // Uses shared test key for all users until Extended Exchange provides individual accounts
  return '5bb3aa57fe654c1300f3a02a31f1cf52'; // Allows real trading orders
}

// Future: When Extended Exchange individual account API is ready
// Framework is already implemented - just uncomment the API call code
```
