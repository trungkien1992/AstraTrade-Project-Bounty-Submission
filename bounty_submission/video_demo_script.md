# AstraTrade Video Demo Script for StarkWare Bounty Judges

## Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**Narrator**: "Welcome to our AstraTrade demo for the StarkWare bounty submission. AstraTrade is a gamified perpetuals trading application that transforms complex blockchain trading into an intuitive, engaging cosmic experience. In this demo, we'll showcase how our implementation meets the key bounty requirements."

**Visuals**:

## Mobile-First Frontend with Flutter (0:30 - 1:30)

**Narrator**: "First, let's look at our mobile-first frontend built with Flutter. Our app provides a seamless experience across iOS and Android devices with a cosmic-themed interface that abstracts complex trading mechanics."

**Visuals**:
- Navigating through different screens
- Showing responsive design on different device sizes
- Highlighting the 3D planet visualization

**Narrator**: "The app features a central interactive 3D planet that evolves visually as users engage with the platform. This provides an immersive experience that aligns with our 'Cosmic Catalyst' philosophy."

## Gamified Elements (1:30 - 2:30)

**Narrator**: "Next, let's explore the gamified elements that make AstraTrade engaging. We've implemented a complete XP system, streak tracking, levels, and a visual leaderboard."

**Visuals**:
- Showing XP accumulation through trading
- Demonstrating streak tracking
- Viewing the leaderboard with avatars

**Narrator**: "Users earn XP through trading activities and daily engagement. Streaks provide additional bonuses, and the leaderboard fosters competition with visual planet icons for each trader."

## Seamless Onboarding with Web3Auth (2:30 - 3:30)

**Narrator**: "Our onboarding process uses Web3Auth for seamless social login. Users can quickly get started with Google or Apple authentication."

**Visuals**:

**Narrator**: "We support three wallet creation methods: fresh wallet creation, importing an existing wallet, and social login through Web3Auth. This provides flexibility while maintaining security."

## Gasless Transactions via Paymaster (3:30 - 4:30)

**Narrator**: "One of our key features is gasless transactions through AVNU paymaster integration. This removes friction for users by covering transaction fees."

**Visuals**:
- Showing transaction history
- Highlighting gasless transaction indicators
- AVNU integration status

**Narrator**: "Users can perform blockchain operations without worrying about gas fees, making the experience more accessible to newcomers."

## Smart Contract Implementation (4:30 - 5:30)

**Narrator**: "Our smart contracts are implemented in Cairo and deployed on Starknet. We've enhanced the paymaster, vault, and created a new exchange contract."

**Visuals**:
- Code snippets of smart contracts
- Compilation process
- Contract deployment

**Narrator**: "All contracts compile successfully with Scarb 2.8.0 and include proper error handling and event emission for monitoring."

## Security Improvements (5:30 - 6:00)

**Narrator**: "Security was a major focus in our implementation. We've secured API keys using environment variables instead of hardcoding them."

**Visuals**:
- Before/after comparison of API key handling
- .env file example
- .gitignore configuration

**Narrator**: "This significantly improves our security posture and aligns with best practices for handling sensitive credentials."

## Advanced Analytics and A/B Testing (6:00 - 7:00)

**Narrator**: "Our development infrastructure includes advanced analytics and A/B testing capabilities."

**Visuals**:
- Analytics dashboard
- A/B testing interface
- Conversion optimization features

**Narrator**: "We've built a comprehensive analytics system with real-time performance monitoring and A/B testing to continuously optimize the user experience."

## Future Implementation Roadmap (7:00 - 7:30)

**Narrator**: "While our current implementation demonstrates core functionality, we have a clear roadmap for full bounty fulfillment."

**Visuals**:
- Roadmap slide
- Planned features

**Narrator**: "We're working on Starknet.dart SDK integration, real perpetual trading with Extended Exchange API, enhanced gamification with 3D ecosystem and NFT rewards, and native mobile features."

## Conclusion (7:30 - 8:00)

**Narrator**: "In conclusion, AstraTrade demonstrates our capability to build a high-quality, secure, and engaging application that aligns with StarkWare bounty requirements. Our implementation shows technical excellence, security focus, and a clear path to full feature completion."
